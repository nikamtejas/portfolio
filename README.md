# portfolio
A portfolio in React that is responsive adjusts to different screen sizes, providing optimal viewing experiences for users on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The React components used in the portfolio are designed to flex and resize according to the width of the screen, ensuring that text, images, and other content is displayed correctly.
